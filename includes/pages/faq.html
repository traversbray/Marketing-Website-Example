We have made our Pricing Information, Return Policy, and FAQ easy to find and access on our website, for your reference. Why? Because we don't think you should have to call a high-pressure sales representative to get basic information. Below we've provided answers to some of the most common questions asked by agents. If you have a question not listed on this page, please feel free to contact us and we'll be happy to address your inquiry.

  <h2 class="faq-header">What's the difference between All Web Leads and other lead referral companies?</h2>
    <p class="faq-paragraph">
      We understand that it can be difficult to find a good lead provider, one that has types of leads, the filters, and the terms you are searching for. At All Web Leads we offer a wide range of leads and filters to help you target your market, and our No Deposit, No Minimums, No Commitment system makes it easy for you to try us out.
    </p>

  </div>

  <h2 class="faq-header">How does your system work?</h2>
    <p class="faq-paragraph">
      Start by creating an account online. During the signup process (no obligation) you will select the types of leads, filters, and geographic areas you are interested in.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="faq-paragraph">
      After confirming your configuration online, simply enter your credit card information on our secure site and
confirm your email address. You are now ready to start receiving real-time leads delivered to your online account and email address. If you ever need to make an adjustment to your account settings, our online system makes it easy with 24-7 access.

  <h2 class="faq-header">How are the leads generated?</h2>
    <p class="faq-paragraph">
Because we have no minimum number of leads to purchase and no long-term commitments, we believe the best way to keep our customers coming back for more leads is to produce a quality product. That's why the majority of our leads are generated from consumers looking for insurance on major internet search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and MSN. This is the most effective way to generate high-quality leads from serious insurance shoppers.    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="faq-paragraph">
      We operate a network of websites where consumers actively shopping for insurance request quotes. After submitting a quote request on our website, the prospect is sent an email reminding them they will soon be contacted by an agent. In the meantime, the prospect may be redirected to a trusted partner, where they can browse an instant quote while waiting for your call. This process keeps the prospect occupied and less likely to visit other sites.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="faq-paragraph">
      To diversify our lead acquisition a small percentage of our leads come from carefully selected partners, all of whom are closely monitored for quality and only approved after a thorough screening process. We do not use or tolerate any incentive-based methods to generate leads.
    </p>

  <h2 class="faq-header">Do I have to pay up front for my leads?</h2>
    <p class="faq-paragraph">
      No. There is no setup fee and no deposit. Credit limits for new agents with All Web Leads are set at $50. After signing up, we will charge your credit card on the 1st and 16th of each month, as well as when your credit limit is reached, for leads you have already received.

    <h2 class="faq-header">What happens if I get an invalid lead?</h2>
      <p class="faq-paragraph">
        We make returning leads a simple, no-hassle process. If you get an invalid lead, you can return it online within 10 days if it meets any of the following conditions:
      </p>
      <p class="faq-paragraph">
        <strong>a)</strong> all phone numbers provided are disconnected or fax,
      </p>
      <p class="faq-paragraph">
        <strong>b)</strong> the lead is a duplicate already received from All Web Leads,
      </p>
      <p class="faq-paragraph">
        <strong>c)</strong> the contact is another agent testing the system,
      </p>
      <p class="faq-paragraph">
        <strong>d)</strong> the contact is a student researching a school project,
      </p>
      <p class="faq-paragraph">
        <strong>e)</strong> the contact information is obviously incorrect upon initial inspection, or
      </p>
      <p class="faq-paragraph">
        <strong>f)</strong> there is a language barrier with the prospect.

        Each lead returned for credit will be independently verified to ensure it meets the return criteria. For more detailed information about our return policy, click here.

    <h2 class="faq-header">Do I have to sign a contract?</h2>
      <p class="faq-paragraph">
        When you sign up, we do require that you agree to our terms and conditions but we do not require any long term commitment from you. There is no minimum number of leads to buy. If at any time you decide that you want to cancel, just notify us and we will close your account.

      <h2 class="faq-header">How many leads can you provide me each month?</h2>
        <p class="faq-paragraph">
          Since internet traffic varies, it is difficult to guarantee an exact number of leads per month. However, our agents can generally receive the number they require by expanding or reducing their geographic areas and/or lead types. Create an account now and select the leads, filters, and areas you are looking for.

        <h2 class="faq-header">Can I limit the number of leads I receive per day?</h2>
          <p class="faq-paragraph">
            Yes, you can specify different geographic areas as well as a daily maximum for each type of lead you want to receive with our online system. You may receive as few as 3 leads per day, and leads are distributed 7 days a week. All of this is configurable under your control, 24-7, through our website. We give you the power to make changes to your account, as necessary.
